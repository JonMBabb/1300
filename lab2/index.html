           <h2>Welcome to Jon Babb's Widgets and Things!</h2>
           <p>Welcome! Here we are testing Jon Babb's website development skills. Think of it like the Hunger Games of web development for him. If he does good, he'll get a good grade... but if he does bad, then off to the dark web with him! R>I>P> Am I right?? Lol, Jk. We also sell the finest of magical products from Tibetan Monks.</p>

           <p>You need a light to read at night
            For words you cannot see 
            I cannot grow within the dark 
            Knowledge like a tree 
            Needs the Sunrise to be 
            
            Singing, ringing, meaning
            
            There is a darkness I must fight
            I’ll need a deeper light
            To see within the growing night
            Words I cannot see
            You need a light to read at night
            Just like me
            
            Singing, ringing, meaning
            
            What am I?
            Ringing like a wave…
            If you can see me standing near
            You are risen from the grave
            What am I?
            
            Singing, ringing, meaning
            
            What am I?
            Ringing like a wave…
            You must have light, you must be brave
            Ringing, singing by the grave
            What am I?
            
            Singing, ringing, meaning
            
            -From a short story by Jon Babb "Triely Poely"
