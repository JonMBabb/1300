            The Sun rose above an unending, ever-present horizon, its excitement rising too as it approached giving light to our lonely Island. The Crimson Sun’s outline was a halo of perfectly spherical light and appeared as a glowing flame behind a round circlet of rose-colored glass—the flaming center visibly dancing, but to only those with eyes worthy to look at it. The singular flame flickered within, bouncing very exactly when it did, but only did so at seemingly random intervals—like a heart trying to find its rhythm after a skipped beat, or a guitarist tuning his guitar to play a new song for the first time. -Triely Poely
